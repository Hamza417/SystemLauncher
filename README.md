# MiUI System Launcher for Poco phones
### Hamza417 @ xda-developers
*Adds native System Launcher of MiUI in Poco Phones*

### Description
Poco Phones including Poco F1 and Poco X2 ships Poco Launcher with their phones and doesn't include the default MiUI System Launcher that comes with the MiUI. The problem with Poco Launcher is it doesn't support many reactive animations as the default System Launcher does such as unlocked animation and some other animations that Poco Launcher lacks. Poco Launcher fails to trigger some animations after reboot until it is set to default launcher again after replacing it.

This module fixes these problems by adding the native MiUI System Launcher into the /System/priv-app in such phones that runs on MiUI but don't include the native launcher.

### Notes
This module doesn't add any extra modifications to the system and after installing this module the launcher updates can be installed as regular apps.
