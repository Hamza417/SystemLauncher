# MiUI System Launcher for Poco phones
*Adds native System Launcher of MiUI in Poco Phones*

## Description
Poco Phones including Poco F1 and Poco X2 ships Poco Launcher with their phones 
and doesn't include the default MiUI System Launcher that comes with the MiUI. 
The problem with Poco Launcher is it doesn't support many reactive animations as 
the default System Launcher does such as unlocked animation, gesture animations and 
some other animations. Poco Launcher also fails to trigger some animations 
after reboot until it is set to default launcher again after replacing it. Overall Poco 
Launcher does not integrate well with MiUI and it's outright bad.

This module fixes these problems by adding the native MiUI System Launcher into the 
/System/priv-app in such phones that runs on MiUI but don't include the native launcher.
